There is a small issue, Qwen2.5 is only designed to convert text, i.e. strings in Python, to tokens, while our dataset is a timeseries composed of 2 variables prey and predator over a time series of size 100, this is repated for a 1000 samples. Thus, before we proceed with tokenisation, we require to convert the time series data into sets of strings. To do so we are going to define a fucntion `array_to_string(data)`, and a function to convert string to array `sring_to_array(formatted_string)` (both functions are in [preprocessor.py](https://github.com/MatteoMancini01/M2_Cw/blob/main/src/preprocessor.py))."
